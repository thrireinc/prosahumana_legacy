# Prosa Humana (Legacy)
Prosa Humana is a legacy project created by the former members of the extinguished Hiscom Studios. This was created while we were game design students of Universidade Anhembi Morumbi as part of our 3rd semester evalutation.

<h2> Goals </h2>
<p>
  The main goal during this project was to create a game based on one of many stories created by Philip K. Dick. We chose Second Variety. The idea was to create a game were the user had to fight a series of different enemies and discover what was happening with his world.

<h2> Achieved </h2>
<p>
  In order to do what we proposed, we created a cartoonized 2d plataformer where the player should finish a lot of different levels with different scenarios and enemies to finally understand the full story.
